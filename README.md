# Redux Web App
### Built w/ Redux, HTML Imports & the History API

All files live under the `exports` directory, with rewrites to it in the root, and to index.html in `exports` for the History API.
Redux is used as the Presenter, with views living under the `views` directory, which get pulled in via `<link rel="import">`
